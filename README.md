# Prosper-Loan-Data-Analysis

In this project I reviewed a Prosper Loan data set containing 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including 
loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, 
borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, 
and the latest payment information.

I truly wanted to understand in my analysis which party benefits most in which
situtations from prosper loans: Prosper, Investor or Borrower? How easy is it
for an investor to truly loose all there money on a prosper loan? What loans
are the most likely to make an investor a large return? I also want to
understand how specific credit ratings and scores relate to borrowers 
characteristics. I hope I can provide you with some interesting insights 
into the world of prosper loans by the end of this analysis.
